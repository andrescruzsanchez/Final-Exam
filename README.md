# Data Science Analytics Course: Final Tech-Conomy Project

This repository contains my final project for the Data Science Analytics course, focusing on the Tech-Conomy case study (a fictional scenario). The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, leveraging Python for data extraction, processing, and predictive modeling. The project follows a structured data science pipeline, including:

	•	SQL Querying: Extracting, cleaning, and preprocessing raw data for analysis.
	•	Feature Engineering: Constructing and selecting meaningful features to improve model performance.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms for data-driven insights.
